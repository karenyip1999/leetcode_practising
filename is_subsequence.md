## Task ‚úç
Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. 

(i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

#### Example 1:
Input: ```s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"```

Output: ```true```

#### Example 2:
Input: ```s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"```

Output: ```false```

## Intuition üí¨
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
My initial thoughts were to use a for loop to iterate through t and s to check if the element at s was equal to the element at t.

Then outside of the loop, if the variable holding the index for s was the same as the length of s, then true could be returned as this would show all matches of s were found and in the correct order. 

This was the final approach I took in creating my solution, but tried to make the solution slightly shorter by using a while loop.

## Approach üí°
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
1. I created a variable called sIndex which held the incrementing index for elements in s and initated this to 0
2. I created a variable called tIndex which held the incrementing index for elements in t and initiated this to 0
3. A while loop was used to iterate through s and t whilst sIndex was less than the length of s and whilst tIndex was less than the length of t
4. Inside of the while loop was an if statement that checked if the element in s at the index of sIndex was equal to the element in t at the index of tIndex
5. If they were equal, sIndex was increased by 1
6. Outside of this if statement but still inside of the while loop, tIndex was increased by 1
7. Finally, the boolean result of if sIndex equalled the length of s was returned
